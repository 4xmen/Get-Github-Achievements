# Thank you for your support and help in the progress of the project.

There are some points that I request you to follow for your Pull Requests:

1. Please, if you make changes in the main readme (README.md, README.fa.md, README.de.md), take help from the original README.md sample and do not make many changes in appearance and keep the format.

2. If you want to create a new language. Please create a main README, then create the steps-.. section and in the corresponding folder, follow the step-by-step tutorial according to the original format of the tutorials (appearance can be maintained and changes can only be made in the texts).

3. If you have changed a small section, please provide a full explanation of the reason for the change in that section and if you have created a new file. Explain the reason to us so that the probability of it being merged increases and the explanations are complete and comprehensive

4. Please put it in a new branch if you create a new language for the course. And make all your commits in that branch neat and legible so that our team can be faster in merging commits.

### Thank you to all the programmers who help us in this way 

#### For an open source community ❤️
